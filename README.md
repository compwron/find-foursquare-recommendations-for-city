foursquare data extraction
--------------------------

## Purpose:

Get my foursquare history and find places in a certain location so I can send them to a friend

## Usage:

First, go to https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/explore and get your API key and put it into get_foursquare_data.py

```
pip install requests
python get_foursquare_data.py
cp /tmp/checkins.json .
ruby parse_foursquare_data.rb
```

## Notes

This could be improved in so many ways but it did what I needed it to. I'm just posting it in case it can ever be useful to me or someone in the future.
